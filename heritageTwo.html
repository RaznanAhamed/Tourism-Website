                    <p>The Polonnaruwa Vatage is an ancient architecture dating back to the kingdom of Polonnaruwa. It is believed to have been built during the period of King Parakramabahu I or king Nissanka Malla. It is said that the Vatage was build for two differnt reasons by the two kings. Nevertheless, this ancient architecture would have given a great significance during that time. Located within the ancient city of Polonnaruwa, it is the best preserved example of a vatadage in the country, and has been described as the "ultimate development" of this type of architecture.</p>

                    <p>The Gal Vihara is a rock temple of Lord Buddha situated in the ancient city of Polonnaruwa. This temple was fashioned in the 12th century by king Parakramabahu I. At the center of the temple is four rock statues of Lord Buddha which has been carved into a large granite rock.The images consist of a large seated figure, another smaller seated figure inside an artificial cavern, a standing figure and a reclining figure. These statues are considered to be some of the best examples of ancient Sinhalese sculpting and carving arts, which has made the Gal Vihara the most visited monument at Polonnaruwa.</p>

                    <p>King Parakramabahu's sea or better known as Parakrama samudra is a shallow reservoir, consisting of five seperate reservoirs connected by narrow channels in Polonnaruwa.</p>
                    <p>It is believed that the northernmost reservoir is the oldest among the five reservoirs. The middle and the southernmost section were added during the reign of king Parakramabahu I. This reservoir was built under the quote "do not let even a drop of rainwater in this country to go to the sea without use".</p>
