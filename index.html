                    <p>There are three main styles of Sri Lankan classical dance. They are, the Kandyan dances, low country dances and Sabaragamuwa dances. Of these, the Kandyan style is most prominent. It is a sophisticated form of dance that consists of five sub-categories,</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Ves dance</li>
                        <li>Naiyandi dance</li>
                        <li>Udekki dance</li>
                        <li>Pantheru dance</li>
                        <li>18 vannam</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>A headdress is worn by the male dancers and a drum called the Geta Beraya is used the keep the rhythm. The above three classical dances differ in their forms of body movement, gestures, the costumes worn by the dancers, the size of the drums used and the sound of the rhythm. The types of drums played in the three classical dances too differ, the 'Geta Beraya' is played in Kandyan dancing, the 'Yak Beraya' is played in Ruhunu dancing and 'Davula' is played in Sabaragamuwa dancing. Here 'Beraya' means drum in sinhala. The Gta Bera and Yak Bera is beaten by hands, while the Davula is played with a stick on one side and with one hand on the other side.                         The main distinguishing feature between Kandyan and Sabaragamu dancing, and Ruhunu dancing, is that Ruhunu dancers wear masks. </p>
